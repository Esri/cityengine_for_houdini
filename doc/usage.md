# Palladio Quick Start


## Prerequisites

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7 (and compatible) or Windows 7/8.1/10
* Houdini 17.0 or later (all editions)
* To create CityEngine rule packages, an installation of CityEngine (2019.0 or later)
* For commercial work, a [license](https://esri.com/cityengine) for CityEngine (2019.0 or later)


## Installation

### From Pre-Built Binaries

1. [Download](https://esri.github.io/palladio/#downloads) Palladio 
1. Extract into your `<home>/houdiniX.Y` directory, so that the files end up in the `dso` and `packages` sub-directories.
1. Start Houdini and Palladio will be loaded automatically.

Note: it is NOT necessary to modify the system `PATH` environment variable.

### From Source

1. [Build](build.md) Palladio
1. The `install` step should automatically copy all required files into your `<home>/houdiniX.Y` directory and Palladio is ready to run.


## Execute a simple CityEngine Rule
    
1. In CityEngine, create the following rule file and share it as a rule package (RPK) to disk somewhere (or download one of the provided examples):
   ```
   attr height = 1
   
   @StartRule
   Init -->
      extrude(height)
   ```
1. In Houdini, in a new scene, add a ``grid`` node.
1. Enter the ``grid`` node and add the two Palladio nodes ``pldAssign`` and ``pldGenerate``. Connect them like this: ![](img/extrude01.png)
1. In the ``pldAssign`` node, set the ``Rule Package`` parameter to the path of the previously exported RPK.
1. Make the ``pldGenerate`` node the active render node, this will trigger a "cooking" of the assign and generate nodes and execute the CityEngine Rule. You should now see an extruded grid: ![](img/extrude02.png)

## Overriding Rule Attributes

In the previous section we've used the default value for the ``height`` attribute. Let's use Houdini tools to modify the rule attribute prior to execution.

1. Right click on the ``pldAssign`` node and bring up the spreadsheet view. Observe how the ``height`` primitive parameter is set to 1 for all primitives. This is the rule attribute default value and we're going to override it now. ![](img/attribute01.png)
1. Add an ``AttributeCreate`` node between ``pldAssign`` and ``pldGenerate``.
1. Set the attribute name to ``height`` and the ``Class`` to ``Primitive``. The extrusion vanishes because the default value is 0.
1. Increase the value for ``height`` to see an actual extrusion: ![](img/attribute02.png)

## Working with Material Attributes

Note: we provide a ready-made Houdini Digital Asset with a [CityEngine Material for Mantra](https://github.com/Esri/palladio/releases/download/v1.6.1/PalladioCityEngineMaterial-v2.hdanc).

In this section, we are going to connect a material attribute generated by ``pldGenerate`` with a Mantra shader (the same mechanism can also be used for Viewport materials).

1. Extend the rule from the first section with a ``color`` statement:
    ```
    attr height = 1

    @StartRule
    Init -->
       color(1,0,0)
       extrude(height)
    ```
    ![](img/materials01.png) 
1. In Houdini, select the ``pldGenerate`` node and check the ``Emit material attributes`` check box. Open the spreadsheet to observe a number of material primitive attributes now being emitted by ``pldGenerate``.
1. Add a ``Material`` node and connect it to the ``pldGenerate`` node. Make it the active render node:
    
    ![](img/materials02.png)
1. In the ``Material Palette``, create a new ``Principled Shader`` instance and call it ``CityEngineShader``:

    ![](img/materials03.png)
1. Enter the ``CityEngineShader`` node and connect a ``Parameter`` node to the ``Surface/basecolor`` input:

    ![](img/materials04.png) 

1. Set the name of the ``Parameter`` node to ``color`` and also set the type to ``Color``. This name will match the primitive attribute emitted by ``pldGenerate``.

    ![](img/materials05.png)

1. Back in the network of the ``grid`` node, select the ``Material`` node and select ``/mat/CityEngineShader`` for the ``Material`` parameter.

1. Hit Mantra render and you should see a red box in the render view.
