# ![](doc/img/Palladio_icon_v1_32.png) ArcGIS CityEngine for Houdini

ArcGIS CityEngine for Houdini is a plugin for [SideFX Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com). It provides operator nodes which enable the execution of [CityEngine](https://www.esri.com/software/cityengine) ‘rules’ within Houdini networks. Therefore, a 3D environment artist does not have to leave their familiar Houdini toolset anymore to make use of CityEngine’s procedural modeling power. Complicated export-import pipelines are no longer needed, which also means that the procedural building models do not need to be “baked” anymore. The buildings stay procedural during the entire modeling workflow (optionally even at render time). Consequently, the 3D environment artist can change the height, style and appearance of buildings easily with a parametric interface at any point during production.

CityEngine for Houdini requires so-called rule packages (RPK) as input, which are authored in CityEngine. An RPK includes assets and a CGA rule file which encodes an architectural style. Comprehensive RPK examples are available below and can be used “out-of-the-box”.

CityEngine for Houdini is well suited for managing the procedural generation of architectural 3D content in digital sets. However, it is restricted to the procedural generation of single buildings / objects. CityEngine for Houdini does not include the city layouting and street network editing tools of CityEngine i.e. the rich CityEngine toolset to design a city from scratch (or based on geographic data) is still needed.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest CityEngine for Houdini binary from the [release page](https://github.com/esri/cityengine_for_houdini/releases).
1. Extract the archive into your `<home>\Documents\houdiniX.Y` (Windows) or `<home>/houdiniX.Y` (Linux) directory, so that the files end up in the corresponding `config`, `dso` and `packages` sub-directories.
1. Start Houdini and you will find the new `pldAssign` and `pldGenerate` nodes in the OBJ operator menu under `custom`.
1. In Houdini, create a quad as initial shape by setting up a `grid` node with 2 cols/rows.
1. Open the geometry node in the network editor and connect the mesh output to a new `pldAssign` node.
1. Create a new `pldGenerate` node and connect the input to the ouput of the previous `pldAssign` node.
1. Make the `pldGenerate` node the active render node.
1. Download [the Parthenon rule package](/doc/data/parthenon.rpk). Or alternatively, in CityEngine, download [Tutorial 9](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/tutorials/tutorial-9-advanced-shape-grammar.htm) and export the "Parthenon" CGA rule to a RPK (see [Creating a Rule Package](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/help/help-rule-package.htm)).
1. Select the `pldAssign` node and set the `Rule Package` parameter in the parameter editor to the path of the previously exported RPK.
1. The model should generate and rule attributes should now be editable inside the parameter editor.

### Installation

#### Software Requirements (Latest Release)

- Windows 10 or 11 (64bit)
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 and compatible (CentOS, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, ...)
- Houdini 20.0, 20.5, 21.0
- See [release notes](#release-notes) for compatible CityEngine versions and requirements for commercial work. 

#### From Pre-Built Binaries

1. Download the latest CityEngine for Houdini binary from the [release page](https://github.com/esri/cityengine_for_houdini/releases).
1. Extract the archive into your `<home>\Documents\houdiniX.Y` (Windows) or `<home>/houdiniX.Y` (Linux) directory, so that the files end up in the `config`, `dso` and `packages` sub-directories.
1. Start Houdini and you will find the new `pldAssign` and `pldGenerate` nodes in the OBJ operator menu under `custom`.

Note: it is NOT necessary to modify the system `PATH` environment variable.

#### From Source

1. [Build](#developer-manual) CityEngine for Houdini
1. The `install` step should automatically copy all required files into your `<home>\Documents\houdiniX.Y` (Windows) or `<home>/houdiniX.Y` (Linux) directory and CityEngine for Houdini is ready to run.

### Using CityEngine for Houdini

CityEngine for Houdini adds the two new geometry (SOP) nodes `pldAssign` and `pldGenerate` to Houdini in the 'Custom' category. These can be created inside of any geometry object in the `Network Editor`.

#### pldAssign Node

The `pldAssign` node is designed to create the required metadata to the input geometry (as primitive attributes) such that the `pldGenerate` operator can procedurally generate the geometry.
When selected, a RPK (rule package), seed and corresponding CGA attributes can directly be set in the parameter editor.
When evaluated, the `pldAssign` node attaches the required metadata to the geometry (in the form of primitive attributes) and updates the CGA attributes in the parameter editor accordingly.
The primitive attributes can also be overwritten before the geometry is passed to a `pldGenerate` node (i.e using an `Attribute Create` node).

#### pldGenerate Node

The `pldGenerate` node is used to generate the final geometry. It takes an initial shape geometry with metadata as input (i.e. the output of a `pldAssign` node) and executes the CityEngine rule to generate a 3D model. In the parameter editor we have the options to:

- Re-emit modified CGA attributes (off by default)
- Emit material attributes (off by default)
- Emit CGA reports (off by default)
- Triangulate polygons with holes (on by default). If disabled, CityEngine for Houdini will create "holes with bridges" similar to the [Hole](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/hole.html) geometry node.

### Execute a simple CityEngine Rule

1. In CityEngine, create the following rule file and share it as a rule package (RPK) to disk somewhere (or download one of the provided examples and share it as a RPK (see [Creating a Rule Package](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/help/help-rule-package.htm))):

   ```
   attr height = 1

   @StartRule
   Init -->
      extrude(height)
   ```

   (Instead you can also directly use [this](doc/data/heightExtrude.rpk) RPK)

1. In Houdini, in a new scene, add a `grid` node.
1. Enter the `grid` node, set the `Rows` and `Columns` parameters to two and add the two CityEngine for Houdini nodes `pldAssign` and `pldGenerate`. Connect them like this:

   ![](doc/img/extrude01.png)

1. Select the `pldAssign` node and set the `Rule Package` parameter to the path of the previously exported RPK in the parameter editor.
1. Make the `pldGenerate` node the active render node, this will trigger a "cooking" of the assign and generate nodes and execute the CityEngine Rule. You should now see a cuboid:

   ![](doc/img/extrude02.png)

### Overriding Rule Attributes

In the previous section we've used the default value for the `height` attribute. Let's use Houdini tools to modify the rule attribute prior to execution.

#### Using Parameter Editor

1. Make sure the `pldAssign` is evaluated by making the connected `pldGenerate` the active render node
1. Edit the rule attribute in the parameter editor by changing the value in the generated handle (a rule attribute can be reset by calling `revert to Defaults` or pressing `ctrl + MMB` on the rule name)

   ![](doc/img/attribute03.png)

#### Manual Override

1. Add an `AttributeCreate` node between `pldAssign` and `pldGenerate`.
1. Set the attribute name to `height` and the `Class` to `Primitive`. The extrusion vanishes because the default value is 0.
1. Increase the value for `height` to see an actual extrusion:

   ![](doc/img/attribute02.png)

Please note the steps for the general case:

1. See the CGA file (or CityEngine) for the available attributes and their data types (number, string, boolean).
1. In the `AttributeCreate` node, set `name` to the name of the CGA attribute (make sure to check `Encode Invalid Attribute Names`).
1. Set `class` to `Primitive`.
1. Set `type` to `Float` for CGA number attributes, `String` for CGA strings and `Integer` with 8 bit precision for CGA booleans.

### Working with multiple Assign Nodes

In this section, we are going to showcase how we can use multiple `pldAssign` nodes with a single `pldGenerate` node.

1. Duplicate the `grid` and `pldAssign` nodes.
1. Set the Center of the second `grid` node to (15, 0, 0).
1. Add a new `Attribute Create` node between the new `grid` and `pldAssign` nodes.
1. Set the attribute name to "primCls", change the Class to primitive and change its value to 1. This value needs to be set such that the `pldGenerate` node later knows which initial faces should be generated together or separately.

   ![](doc/img/multiple01.png)

1. Merge the output of both assign nodes with a `merge` node and feed the output to the previous generate node like this:

   ![](doc/img/multiple02.png)

1. You can now change the rule files and attributes of both `pldAssign` nodes and it should generate them correctly

   ![](doc/img/multiple03.png)

### Working with Material Attributes

In this section, we are going to connect a material attribute generated by `pldGenerate` with a Mantra shader (the same mechanism can also be used for Viewport materials).

#### Using provided HDA

1. Download the ready-made Houdini Digital Asset with a [CityEngine Material for Mantra](https://github.com/esri/cityengine_for_houdini/releases/download/v1.6.1/PalladioCityEngineMaterial-v2.hdanc).
1. Import the HDA to your current project (`File`>`Import`>`Houdini Digital Asset`) and click install.
1. Select the `pldGenerate` node and check the `Emit material attributes` check box. Open the spreadsheet to observe a number of material primitive attributes now being emitted by `pldGenerate`.
1. Create a new PalladioCityEngineMaterial node and connect it to the `pldGenerate` node. Make it the active render node.
1. Hit Mantra render and you should see a red box in the render view.

   ![](doc/img/importHDA01.png)

#### Creating a new custom Shader

1. Extend the rule from the [previous section](#execute-a-simple-cityengine-rule) with a `color` statement and re-export it:

   ```
   attr height = 1

   @StartRule
   Init -->
      color(1,0,0)
      extrude(height)
   ```

   (Instead you can also directly use [this](doc/data/heightExtrude.rpk) RPK)
   ![](doc/img/materials01.png)

1. In Houdini, select the `pldGenerate` node and check the `Emit material attributes` check box. Open the spreadsheet to observe a number of material primitive attributes now being emitted by `pldGenerate`.
1. Add a `Material` node and connect it to the `pldGenerate` node. Make it the active render node:

   ![](doc/img/materials02.png)

1. In the `Material Palette`, create a new `Principled Shader` instance (by dragging it from the navigator to the `\mat` window) and rename it to `CityEngineShader`:

   ![](doc/img/materials03.png)

1. Enter the `CityEngineShader` node and connect a `Parameter` node to the `Surface/basecolor` input:

   ![](doc/img/materials04.png)

1. Set the name of the `Parameter` node to `diffuseColor` and also set the type to `Color`. This name will match the primitive attribute emitted by `pldGenerate`.

   ![](doc/img/materials05.png)

1. Back in the network of the `grid` node, select the `Material` node and select `/mat/CityEngineShader` for the `Material` parameter.

1. Hit Mantra render and you should see a red box in the render view.

   ![](doc/img/materials06.png)

### Tips and Tricks

#### How to export an Alembic from CityEngine as input to CityEngine for Houdini

This short CityEngine guide explains how to include the random seed and start rule assignments when exporting input geometry to Alembic.

1. Run the following Python script on your scene objects to assign the random seed as object attributes:

   ```python
   from scripting import *

   ce = CE()

   shapes = ce.getObjectsFrom(ce.scene(), ce.isShape)
   for s in shapes:
       seed = ce.getAttribute(s, "/ce/rule/randomSeed")
       ce.setAttribute(s, "seed", seed)
   ```

1. Assign this CGA script to the desired shapes to report out `seed` and `rule` (the start rule):

   ```
   version "2019.0"

   attr seed = 0

   Lot --> R
   LotInner --> R
   Street --> R
   Sidewalk --> R
   Crossing --> R
   OpenSpace --> R
   Joint --> R
   R -->
       report("seed", seed)
       report("rule", initialShape.startRule)
   ```

   The `seed` rule attribute should have been connected to the previously assigned `seed` object attribute.

1. Export the shapes to Alembic, the two report values are now attached as user properties to the meshes.

#### Keep CityEngine Rule Packages in the Houdini Project

It can be useful to put RPKs into an `rpk` sub-directory of your current Houdini project. If you use `$HIP` to refer to the RPK in the pldAssign node, your Houdini project will stay relocatable.

#### Environment Variables

- `CITYENGINE_LOG_LEVEL`: controls the global (minimal) log level for all assign and generate nodes. Valid values are "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "fatal". The default is "error". Additionally, the log level can be controlled for each `pldAssign` and `pldGenerate` instance.
- `HOUDINI_DSO_ERROR`: useful to debug loading issues, see https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/env

### v1.3.1 (Feb 20, 2019)

- Added a workaround to prevent a crash in PRT 1.9 when using an invalid CGB path in the assign node.

### v1.3.0 (Jan 20, 2019)

- Update build system to support both Houdini 16.5 and 17.0.
- For Houdini 17, use bundled boost libraries.

### v1.2.0 (Jan 17, 2019)

- Build System changes to improve continuous integration support (Jenkins).
- Updated required cmake version to 3.13 (preparation for Houdini 17 support).
- Added pipenv script for easier access to conan.
- Reduced Houdini package size.

### v1.2.0 RC 1 (Jun 11, 2018)

- Support for inter-shape occlusion queries (#33).

### v1.1.1 (Apr 16, 2018)

- Fixed asset loading issues in Windows build (#88).

### v1.1 (Apr 7, 2018)

- Added support for Windows (#85).
- Raised minimal Houdini version to 16.5.x (#85).
- Added support to reload RPKs (#58).

### v1.0 (Jan 26, 2018)

- Renamed project to "Palladio" (#68).
- Updated documentation (#38).
- Published demo scene (#74).

### v0.9 (Jan 18, 2018)

- Add support for writing out primitive attributes from rule/generic CGA attributes (#40).
- Removed random seed parameter UI, read it from incoming primitive attributes instead. Added centroid-based random seed as fallback.
- Correctly update assign node parameters from RPK (#62).
- Make primitive group creation optional and based on primitive classifier (#67).
- Add support for CityEngine network licensing (#41).
- Fixed crash when handling invalid RPK paths.
- Remove style prefix on primitive attribute names.

### v0.8 (Dec 19, 2017)

- Added support for multiple UV sets (#36).
- Added support for CGA reports (#39).
- Properly use Houdini input mesh connectivity (make CGA operation "isClosedSurface" work correctly) (#49).
- Refactored assign node to correctly use incoming geometry to evaluate default rule attribute values.

### v0.7.1 (Nov 27, 2017)

- Proper support for UVs and material attributes.
- Introduced Conan to handle 3rd party packages in the build system (Houdini, CityEngine).
- Updated to CityEngine SDK 2017.1 (CE SDK 1.9).

### v0.7 (Sep 19, 2017)

- Split plugin into two SOPs ("assign" and "generate") to support proper evaluation of rule attribute default values.
- Abandoned rule param UI, purely rely on Houdini attribute tools (e.g. "AttributeCreate") to create/modify rule attributes (= no need for complicated UI on assign node).
- Updated to Houdini 16 and CityEngine 2017.
- Dropped Windows/macOS support temporarily.

### v0.6 (Mar 15, 2016)

- Support for rule attribute UI via Houdini multi-parameter.
- Experimental support for Windows/macOS.
- Updated to Houdini 15 and CityEngine 2016.

### v0.4 (Oct 22, 2015)

- Working geometry generation from CityEngine rule packages
- Support to read rule attributes from primitive attributes
- Implemented rule execution as single surface operator (SOP).
- Updated to Houdini 13 and CityEngine 2015.

### v0.1 - v0.3 (Spring 2015)

- Early experiments with Houdini 12 and CityEngine 2014.

## Community

CityEngine for Houdini is maintained as an open-source project by Matthias Buehler ([vrbn studios](https://www.vrbn.io)) and Simon Haegler (Esri R&D Zurich). Matthias is focusing on UX/UI topics and use-cases, while Simon is focusing on the implementation and procedural modelling technology.

Our goal is to bring as many Houdini and CityEngine users and developers on board as possible. Anyone is invited to submit issues and/or to fork and contribute to this project.

Our thanks also go to the fine folks at Esri R&D Zurich and vrbn studios which provided valuable comments and feedback.

## History

CityEngine for Houdini has been invented by Matthias Buehler and Simon Haegler in early 2015. It started out as a research project at Esri R&D Zurich to get to a tighter integration of CityEngine and Houdini than just via file-based import/export of assets. Early results were promising, so we slowly cooked the project to v1.0 in our spare time. In December 2017, we decided to open-source CityEngine for Houdini with an Apache 2.0 license.
