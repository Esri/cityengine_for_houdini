Palladio is a plugin for [SideFX Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com). It provides operator nodes which enable the execution of [Esri CityEngine](http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine) 'rules' within Houdini networks. This provides a convenient combination of the generic procedural modelling capabilities of Houdini with the architecture-specific procedural modeling language 'CGA' of CityEngine.

Palladio is not an Esri nor vrbn product and there is currently no official/commercial support from Esri nor vrbn. However, if you are interested in commercial services related to Palladio, please contact info@vrbn.io

## Community

Palladio is maintained as an open-source project by Matthias Buehler (vrbn.io) and Simon Haegler (Esri R&D Zurich). Matthias is focusing on UX/UI topics and use-cases in Urban Planning, while Simon is focusing on the implementation and procedural modelling technology.

Our goal is to bring as many Houdini and CityEngine users and developers on board as possible. Anyone is invited to submit issues and/or to fork and contribute to this project.

Our thanks also go to the fine folks at Esri R&D Zurich and VRBN which provided valuable comments and feedback.


## History

Palladio has been invented by Matthias Buehler and Simon Haegler in early 2015. It started out as a research project at Esri R&D Zurich to get to a tighter integration of CityEngine and Houdini than just via file-based import/export of assets. Early results were promising, so we slowly cooked the project to v1.0 in our spare time. In December 2017, we decided to open-source Palladio with an Apache 2.0 license.
